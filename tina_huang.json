I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) \n\n\ud83d\udce7Contact\n========================\nyoutube: youtube comments are by far the best way to get a response from me! \nlinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaw-h/ \nemail for business inquiries only: hellotinah@gmail.com \n\n========================\nSome links are affiliate links and I may receive a small portion of sales price at no cost to you.

I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) \n\n\ud83d\udce7Contact\n========================\nyoutube: youtube comments are by far the best way to get a response from me! \nlinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaw-h/ \nemail for business inquiries only: hellotinah@gmail.com \n\n========================\nSome links are affiliate links and I may receive a small portion of the sales price at no cost to you.

Arvind is not only the director of MCIT, professor, and my past boss (I was a TA for one of his classes), but also an incredible mentor and human being. He's honest, extremely intelligent, caring, and humble (sorry Arvind I know I'm probably embarrassing you haha).

                    "description": "This is a step by step guide for how I learned SQL for my FANG data science interview. I had never touched SQL before and only had 2 weeks to prepare for my interview. So I made a scientifically-backed study plan to learn SQL most efficiently with the least amount of time and effort. By the end of the 11 days, I felt super confident and prepared. I went on to pass my FANG data science interviews and got the job! \n\nMy motto: Minimize effort and maximize outcome!!\n\nBtw apologies about audio quality from about 2  - 3.5 min mark. Something weird happened to my mic :( \n______________________________________________________________________\nTimestamps: \n00:00 Overview \n01:01 Study Plan \n06:00 SQL Interview Demo \n08:47 End of Demo\n09:36 Final Thoughts \n______________________________________________________________________\nContact:\nemail: hellotinah@gmail.com\nlinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaw-h/\n______________________________________________________________________\nMusic Credit: \nPotato Deal - Craig MacArthur \nSmile - Slynk \n______________________________________________________________________\nrelevant topics: mysql, postgresql, postgresql tutorial ,postgresql tutorial for beginners"
